This will be a short introduction regarding my project.
Basic information regarding the protocol and programming languages I have learnt within the first couple of weeks of my course at Code Institute.
These languages/tools include but are not limited to: HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap4. I have used my GitHub to keep track of changes made to my internal code, and professionally managing each project I encounter whilst on my course.


I am hoping to delve into the current housing crisis many homeless people face in our country. trying to jump through the hoops of coorperate jargon and waiting times. 
Plus the overall inequality and adverse personification's portrayed onto them by the public.
I will also be explaining the difficulty young people face attempting to get on the property ladder as first time buyers.

Being able to do a piece on this which is something our country seems to be struggling with at this time of uncertainty with Brexit and the like. So I would also like to give a small preview into the business's and communities that are gojng that extra mile to accomodate these less than equipped people in times of hardship.
