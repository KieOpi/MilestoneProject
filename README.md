This will be a short introduction about my project.
Basic information regarding the protocols and programming languages I have learnt within the first couple of weeks of my course at Code Institute.

These languages/tools include but are not limited to: HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap4, VScode and Wire Frame. I have used my GitHub to keep track of changes made to my internal code, and professionally managing each section and project I encounter whilst on my course.


I am hoping to delve into the current housing crisis many homeless people face in our country. Trying to jump through the hoops of coorperate jargon and waiting times they face to become "citizens". 
Plus the overall adverse inequality and personification's portrayed onto them by the public.

(I would also like to give you an opportunity to read interviews with people in such dramatic circumstances, Not for the sympathy vote, but for the idealism that things could be worse and that all we can really do, is to keep on trucking!)
I will also be explaining the difficulty young people face attempting to get on the property ladder as first time buyers.

Being able to do a piece on this which is something our country seems to be struggling with at this time of uncertainty with Brexit and the like. So I would also like to give a small preview into the business's and communities that are going that extra mile to accomodate these less than equipped people in times of hardship.
